This repository contains the known hosts blocklists that are made available to the users of AdGuard products ([AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.com/), [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome), etc).

Some of these blocklists are automatically [converted](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistCompiler) to the rules format that AdGuard product understand better.

## <a id="published"></a> Where Blocklists Are Published

- [`filters.json`](https://adguardteam.github.io/HostlistsRegistry/assets/filters.json) contains all the blocklists added to the repo. `downloadURL` is the location of the re-hosted blocklist.
- [`services.json`](https://adguardteam.github.io/HostlistsRegistry/assets/services.json) is the meta-data of "Web Services". This is a part of the parental control functionality of AdGuard Home and AdGuard DNS.

## <a id="what-blocklists"></a> What Blocklists Can Be Added Here

- The blocklist should be oriented towards DNS-level content blockers. There is a different [repo](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry) for browser content blockers.
- We prefer (mostly) original lists to compilations.
- We prefer blocklists that are specifically made for [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) and use [adblock-style syntax](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Hosts-Blocklists#adblock-style). Lists that use `/etc/hosts` can also be added if there is no alternative.
- The blocklist should have a clear purpose.

  Examples:

  - good: "blocks TV ads".
  - bad: "John Doe's personal blocklist"

- The blocklist should have a place for receiving user complaints and holding discussions, such as a repository on github.com, or a public website/forum.
- The blocklist should be relatively popular, meaning:
  - if there is a repository on GitHub, the number of stars should be at least 50.
  - if there is no repository on GitHub, the number of reported issues and discussions should be at least 10 per month.
  - the blocklist should be actively supported for at least 6 months.
- The blocklist should be regularly updated with at least 10 updates per month.
- Previously added blocklists that haven't received any support for a year will be removed. We reserve the right to remove the blocklist earlier, depending on circumstances.
- If the blocklist contains too many problematic rules, it will not be added. A rule is considered problematic if it causes false positives or otherwise displays unitended behavior. Decisions about blocklists with problematic rules are arbitrary and there may be exceptions.
- If the blocklist intentionally blocks or restricts access to a service for no reason other than being a reflection of the filter author's opinion, the blocklist will not get added, or will get removed if already added.
- If the blocklist is popular in a specific region and there are no alternatives to it, then it can be added as is even if it does not satisfy requirements above.

## <a id="how-to-add-a-filter-list"></a> How to add a filter list

To add a new filter, you need to:

  1. Go to the filters folder.
  2. Go to the category to which the new filter will belong.
  3. Create a new folder with the name `filter_(id)_(filter name)`.
  4. Create two files in this folder: `configuration.json` and `metadata.json`. The contents of these files are described below.
  5. In the file `locales/en/filters.json` add an object with the name and description of the filter according to the example added above.

The files `/assets/filters.json` and `/assets/filters-dev.json` must not be edited manually.

## <a id="filters-meta"></a> Filters Metadata

- `metadata.json`

  Filter metadata. Includes name, description, etc.

  - `filterKey` — unique human-readable filter identifier (string)
  - `filterId` - unique internal filter identifier (integer)
  - `name` — filter name; can be localized
  - `description` — filter description
  - `timeAdded` — time when this filter was added to the registry; milliseconds since January 1, 1970; you can exec `new Date().getTime()` in the browser console to get the current time
  - `homepage` — filter website/homepage
  - `expires` — filter's default expiration period
  - `displayNumber` — this number is used when AdGuard sorts available filters (GUI)
  - `environment` - either `dev` or `prod`. Only `prod` lists are available in AdGuard DNS.
  - `disabled` - if set to `true`, the blocklist won't be updated.
  - `tags` — a list of [tags](#tags)

    <details>
      <summary>Metadata example</summary>

  ```json
  {
    "filterKey": "adguard_dns_filter",
    "filterId": 1,
    "name": "AdGuard DNS filter",
    "description": "Filter composed of several other filters (AdGuard Base filter, Social Media filter, Tracking Protection filter, Mobile Ads filter, EasyList and EasyPrivacy) and simplified specifically to be better compatible with DNS-level ad blocking.",
    "timeAdded": 1404115015843,
    "homepage": "https://kb.adguard.com/general/adguard-ad-filters",
    "expires": "4 days",
    "displayNumber": 3,
    "environment": "prod",
    "tags": []
  }
  ```

    </details>

- `revision.json`

  Filter version metadata, automatically filled and overwritten on each build.

- `filter.txt`

  Resulting compiled filter.

- `configuration.json`

  Configuration defines your filter list sources, and the transformations that are applied to the sources. See [Hostlist compiler configuration](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistCompiler#configuration) for details

### <a id="tags"></a> Tags

Every filter can be marked by a number of tags. Every tag metadata listed in `/tags/metadata.json`.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```json
{
  "tagId": 1,
  "keyword": "purpose:ads"
}
```

</details>

Possible tags:

- `lang:*` — for language-specific filters; one or multiple lang-tags can be used. For instance,
  AdGuard Russian filter is marked with the `lang:ru` tag.

- `purpose:*` — determines filters purposes; multiple purpose-tags can be used for one filter list.

- `recommended` — for low-risk filter lists which are recommended to use in their category. The
  category is determined by the pair of the `lang:*` and `purpose:*` tags.

- `obsolete` — for abandoned filter lists; filter's metadata with this tag will be excluded
  from `filters.json` and `filters_i18n.json`.

## <a id="how-to-add-a-blockable-service"></a> How to add a blockable service

To add a new blocked service, a new `.yml` file must be added to the `services` directory, the contents of the directory and the resulting `services.json` file are described in the next section.

## <a id="services-meta"></a> Services Metadata

The `services.json` file combines information about services received from separate `.yml` files located in the `services` directory. The `services.json` file is generated by a script, so there is no need to modify it manually.

- Source `.yml` files: Each `.yml` file contains information about a specific service. The file name must match its `id`.

- File saving: `.yml` files are stored in the services directory.

- Updating information: In cases when it is necessary to change the configuration of a service, it is necessary to update the corresponding `.yml` file in the services directory.

- Adding a new service: to add a new service to `services.json` it is necessary to add `.yml` file to the services directory, after the script is run the file will be updated.

**WARNING!**

- Deletion of files is strictly forbidden. If a service file is deleted, the script will restore it from a previous version of the `services.json` file.

- It is also forbidden to change service `id` inside the `.yml` file.

Service metadata includes `id`, `name`, `rules`, `icon_svg`:

- `id` — unique human-readable service identifier (string, as `snake_case`)
- `name` — service name (string)
- `rules` — list of domain rules in Adblock syntax (list of strings)
- `icon_svg` — svg icon (string)

## <a id="how-to-build"></a> How to Build

```
yarn install
```

Run the following command:

```
yarn run compose
```

The build result can be found in the `assets` directory.

## <a id="localizations"></a> Localizations

Blocklist names, descriptions, and tags' names are translated via [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/adguard-applications/en#/miscellaneous/hostlists-registry).

`/locales` contains translations for filters, groups, and tags.

Base language strings:

- `locales/en/filters.json`
- `locales/en/tags.json`

In order to prepare these files run `yarn run locales:prepare`.
This script will scan filters meta and add filters names, descriptions, and tags meta to the base language files.

- Upload base language strings: `yarn run locales:upload`
- Download translations: `yarn run locales:download`
